## Section D — evidence issues

Engineer-needed `rules_only` baseline: 55/60 agreement on the model-checked dev set (in-sample), 1 under-flag, 13 abstentions. This baseline fills unstated facts and omits the span handoff; these figures do not measure the Section D issues endpoint.

`GET /cases/{case_id}/section-d/issues`

Recommendations for the evidence an alternative-solution application must address. The list is administrative. It does not decide that a design complies, is safe, or that a supplied professional opinion is adequate. The route is read-only.

An empty list is not returned for a case with no confirmed benchmark. That case returns one issue whose `provision` is null and whose `question` asks for the benchmark.

### Issue

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Stable id for this benchmark and objective/function pair, or an unresolved-reference id. |
| `provision` | object or null | Confirmed Division B provision. Null when the entered reference is not in the code database. |
| `provision.provision_id` | string | Provision id that `codedb` resolved. |
| `provision.division` | `"A"` \| `"B"` \| `"C"` | Division of that row. Benchmark issues use `"B"`. |
| `provision.citation` | string | Citation string copied from the code database. The service does not format its own citation. |
| `entered_reference` | string or null | The applicant's unresolved token. Not a citation. |
| `question` | string or null | Present when the benchmark, the attribution, or the practice screen is incomplete. |
| `objective` | string or null | Objective code from the attribution row, such as `OP3.1`. Null when the table has no row. |
| `function` | string or null | Functional-statement code from the same row, such as `F03`. |
| `at_stake` | string | What the evidence should address. Wording recommends; it does not conclude. |
| `recommended_evidence_types` | string[] | Evidence types in confidence-ladder order. On the alternative path the four extra types follow the ladder: CCMC evaluation, ICC-ES evaluation, registered professional opinion, engineering review. |
| `practice_of_engineering` | object | Whether the stated facts indicate practice of engineering. |
| `empty_process_fields` | object[] | Required alternative-path process fields that still have no confirmed applicant answer. Not evidence types. |
| `status` | string | `open`, `addressed`, or `needs_professional`. |

`empty_process_fields[]`:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | `rationale`, `risk_assessment`, `mitigating_measures`, `assumptions_and_limits`, `maintenance_operation`, or `qualifications`. |
| `label` | string | Prompt label. |
| `citation` | string | Division C documentation provision from the code database. |

Process fields are required on the alternative path. They are not rungs of the evidence ladder. Risk assessment, mitigating measures, and assumptions/limits are not dropped.

### `practice_of_engineering`

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `value` | `true`, `false`, or `"unknown"` | `true` or `false` only when the Division C screen resolves. `"unknown"` when a deciding fact is missing. The service does not guess a boolean. |
| `rule` | string or null | Provision id of the Division C rule that triggered the flag, or of the rule that could not be applied. |
| `division` | `"A"` \| `"B"` \| `"C"` or null | Division of `rule`. |
| `citation` | string or null | That rule's citation from the code database. Omitted when the rule does not resolve. The rule id is one `engine/professional.py` already passes to its screen. |
| `reason` | string | Recommendation tied to the rule. |
| `question` | string or null | Required when `value` is `"unknown"`. |

Confirmed `professional.span_m` (or `span_m`) above 12.20 m is recorded as Part 4 design. This span handoff came from development case dev-050. The cited rule is Div C 2.4.1.2.(1), the same provision `engine/professional.py` already uses for Part 4 design. No other provision id is added for the span.

### `status`

| Value | When |
| --- | --- |
| `needs_professional` | `practice_of_engineering.value` is `true` and no applicant-supplied item linked to the issue names a responsible party or a seal. |
| `addressed` | An applicant-supplied item is linked to the issue (and, if a professional is indicated, a responsible party or seal is named). This records that the item was supplied. It does not assess the item. |
| `open` | No applicant-supplied item is linked. Also used when the practice flag is `"unknown"`. |

### Evidence-type order

Shared ladder, low confidence to high:

1. manufacturer's literature
2. existing STANDATA variance
3. ISO 17025 test report
4. evaluation
5. evaluation + testing
6. qualification
7. ISO 17065 certification

Alternative path only, after the ladder: CCMC evaluation, ICC-ES evaluation, registered professional opinion, engineering review.

### Example

```json
[
  {
    "id": "ev_0123456789abcdef",
    "provision": {
      "provision_id": "9.10.15.5.(8)",
      "division": "B",
      "citation": "<citation string returned by codedb for this provision>"
    },
    "entered_reference": null,
    "question": null,
    "objective": "OP3.1",
    "function": "F03",
    "at_stake": "Recommend evidence that addresses F03 and OP3.1 for benchmark <citation string returned by codedb for this provision>. Identify the proposed configuration, the comparison the responsible designer selects, the report passages they rely on, the differences and the limits.",
    "recommended_evidence_types": ["manufacturer's literature", "existing STANDATA variance"],
    "practice_of_engineering": {
      "value": "unknown",
      "rule": "2.4.1.1.(1)",
      "division": "C",
      "citation": "<citation string returned by codedb for Div C 2.4.1.1.(1)>",
      "reason": "These facts do not establish whether practice of engineering applies. Ask before setting the flag to yes or no.",
      "question": "What is the confirmed occupancy/building type, including each use in a mixed-use building?"
    },
    "empty_process_fields": [
      {
        "id": "risk_assessment",
        "label": "Risk assessment",
        "citation": "<citation string returned by codedb for Div C 2.3.1.1.(3)>"
      }
    ],
    "status": "open"
  }
]
```

A live response copies the citation string the code database returns. The placeholders above are not citations.

### Errors

| Status | When |
| --- | --- |
| 404 | The case does not exist, or a Division C rule the screen names is missing from the code database. |
| 200 | An unknown Division B token does not 404. It returns `provision: null` and a question. |
